# Default contract mapping for the Powell analysis toolkit.
#
# This YAML file defines a mapping from market contract names to
# synonyms or phrase variants that are counted as a “mention” when
# scanning Jerome Powell’s remarks.  Contracts correspond to markets
# offered by prediction exchanges such as Kalshi (e.g. “AI /
# Artificial Intelligence”, “Median”, “Projection”).
#
# Each top‑level key is the contract name as it appears on the
# market.  Under each contract you may specify:
#   synonyms: A list of lowercase strings.  Each string is a
#     variant that should count as a mention.  Synonyms should be
#     written in lowercase for consistency.  The parser will lower
#     case both the transcript and the synonyms before matching.
#   description: (optional) A human‑readable description of the
#     contract.  This field is ignored by the code but may be
#     useful for documentation.
#
# You should adjust this file to match the exact resolution rules of
# the market.  For example, if Kalshi counts any mention of “AI” or
# “artificial intelligence” regardless of context, include both
# variants here.  If the contract resolves only on prepared remarks
# and not Q&A, you could exclude synonyms that appear only in
# reporters’ questions.
